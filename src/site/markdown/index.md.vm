finmath lib cuda extensions
==========

****************************************

**Vector class (RandomVariable) running on GPUs using CUDA.**

**Enabling finmath lib with Cuda via jcuda. - Running finmath lib models on a GPU.**

****************************************

The *finmath lib cuda extensions* provide a **Cuda** implementation of the [finmath lib](http://finmath.net/finmath-lib/) interfaces `RandomVariable` and `BrownianMotion` compatible with finmath lib 4.0.12 or later
(tested on GRID GPU Kepler GK105, GeForce GTX 1080, GeForce GT 750M.

Performance Characteristics
-------------------------------------

<img src="images/LIBORMarketModelCalibrationTest-Graph.png" style="width: 50%; float: right;"/>

The current implementation uses very small CUDA kernels which affects the performance. This may be optimized quite straight forwardly in future version.
This implies a specific performance characteristic: the CUDA communication overhead constitutes a certain amount of "fixed costs".
Depending on GPU and CPU specifics the performance is at par for Monte Carlo simulations with 5000 paths.
However, for larger number of paths, the CPU scales linear, while the GPU show almost no change. That is, For a
Monte-Carlo simulation with 50000 paths, the GPU is 10 times faster than the CPU. For 100000 paths, the GPU is 20 times faster than the CPU.

#[[
### Limitations
]]#

The main limitation is GPU memory. RandomVariable objects are held on the GPU and keept as long as they are referenced.
Since multiple processes may aquire GPU memory, it may be less clear how much GPU memory is available.
Larger Monte-Carlo simulations may require 12 GB or more of GPU memory.

Another aspect that may affect the performance is the CUDA implementation.

Interfaces for which CUDA Implementations are Provided
-------------------------------------
#[[
### RandomVariable
]]#

A `RandomVariableCudaFactory` is provided, which can be injected in any finmath lib model/algorithm using a random variable factory to construct `RandomVariable` objects. Objects created from this factory or from objects created from this factory perform their calculation on the GPU.

The implementation supports type priorities (see http://ssrn.com/abstract=3246127 ) and the default priority of `RandomVariableCuda` is 20. For example: operators involving CPU and GPU vectors will result in GPU vectors.

The `RandomVariableCudaFactory` can be combined with *algorithmic differentiation* AAD wrappers, for example `RandomVariableDifferentiableAAD`, to allow algorithmic differentiation together with calculations performed on the GPU. For the type priority: objects allowing for algorithmic differentiation (AAD) have higher priority, AAD on GPU has higher priority than AAD on CPU.

#[[
### BrownianMotion
]]#

In addition, objects of type `BrownianMotion` are also taking the role of a factory for objects of type `RandomVariable`. Thus, injecting the `BrownianMotionCuda` into classes consuming a `BrownianMotion` will result in finmath-lib models performing their calculations on the GPU - seamlessly.

Distribution
-------------------------------------

finmath-lib-cuda-extensions is distributed through the central Maven repository. It's coordinates are:

    <groupId>net.finmath</groupId>
    <artifactId>finmath-lib-cuda-extensions</artifactId>
	<version>${project.version}</version>


The project is currently build for Cuda 10.2.
For other Cuda versions use the Maven command line property `cuda.version` set to one of `8.0`, `9.2`, `10.0`, `10.1`, `10.2` and the Maven classifyer `cuda-${cuda.version}`.

Example
-------------------------------------

Create a vector of floats on the GPU device

```
RandomVariable randomVariable = new RandomVariableCuda(new float[] {-4.0f, -2.0f, 0.0f, 2.0f, 4.0f} );
```

perform some calculations (still on the GPU device)

```
randomVariable = randomVariable.add(4.0);
randomVariable = randomVariable.div(2.0);
```

perform a reduction on the GPU device

```
double average = randomVariable.getAverage();
```

or get the result vector (to the host)

```
double[] result = randomVariable.getRealizations();
```

(note: the result is always double, since different implementation may support float or double on the device).

Installation / Build
-------------------------------------

Binary distribution is available via Maven central.

You have to have NVIDIA Cuda 10.1 installed. The Maven configuration comes with profiles for Cuda 8.0, 9.2, 10.0 and 10.1.
If you like to use a different version, you can try to switch the JCuda version by setting the property cuda.version
on the Maven command line.

To build the project yourself and run the unit tests from the source repository:

Obtain the finmath-lib-cuda-extensions source

```
git clone https://github.com/finmath/finmath-lib-cuda-extensions.git
cd finmath-lib-cuda-extensions
```

...then build the code.

```
mvn clean package
```

This will build the version using Cuda 10.2. For Cuda 10.1 use

```
mvn -Dcuda.version=10.1 clean package
```

If everything goes well, you will see unit test run. Note that some of the tests may fail if the device (GPU) has not enough memory. 

Trying on Amazon EC2
-------------------------------------

If you do not have a machine with NVidia Cuda 10.0 at hand, you may try out the finmath-lib-cuda-extensions on an Amazon EC2 machine. To do so:

* Create an Amazon AWS account (if needed) an go to your AWS console.
* Select to start an EC2 virtual server.
* Launch a GPU instance
  - Filter the list of images (AMI) using `gpu` and select - e.g. - `Deep Learning Base AMI (Ubuntu) Version 19.0`.
  - Filter the list of servers using the "GPU instances" and select an instance.
* Login to your GPU instance.
* Check that you have cuda 10.0 (e.g. use `nvcc --version`)
* Try finmath-lib-cuda-extensions as described in the previous section.

#[[
### Unit test for LIBOR Market Model calibration
]]#

There is also a unit test performing a brute force Monte-Carlo calibration of a LIBOR Market Model with stochastic volatility on the CPU and the GPU. Note however that the unit test uses a too small size for the number of simulation paths, such that the GPU code is no improvement over the CPU code. The unit test shows that CPU and GPU give consistent results.

The performance of a brute-force Monte-Carlo calibration with 80K and 160K paths are given below. Note: if the number of paths is increased, the GPU time remains almost the same (given that the GPU has sufficient memory), while the CPU time grows linearly. This is due to the fact that the GPU performance has a large part of fixed management overhead (which will be reduced in future versions).

The CPU version was run on a an Intel i7-7800X 3.5 GHz using multi-threadded calibration.
THe GPU version was run on an nVidia GeForce GTX 1080.
